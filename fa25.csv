11/21/2025 21:29:52,dishitar@buffalo.edu,Unfold Studio,"Unfold Studio is a free, web-based learning platform created to support students who find coding intimidating or lack access to programs that teach it, as many existing platforms are too technical or not designed for beginners and social science learners. This creates a barrier for students who could benefit from coding as a way to express creativity and build programming skills. Educators also lack tools to understand or observe how students are using AI, and many students are copy-pasting from AI platforms instead of learning how to think through problems or write on their own. Unfold Studio provides a low pressure, creative environment where students can experiment and gradually learn coding concepts while developing logic and problem-solving skills. The platform combines storytelling, coding, and AI, and students stay in control of when and how AI supports them. It is designed for students and educators in multiple fields, including social sciences, CS, and middle and high school learners, with a primary focus on introductory CS courses. Its flexibility also allows educators in English, Social Studies, and CS to use it for interdisciplinary learning across different fields.",CSE 302/303/402,Includes a demo,https://unfoldstudio.net/,"Dishita Reddy Patil - dishitar@buffalo.edu, Aria Mahbub Orni - ariaorni@buffalo.edu, Ziang Chen - Ziangche@buffalo.edu, Andrea Kyaw - Andreaky@buffalo.edu"

The robot runs a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and track the ball's position in real-time from its camera feed. This vision data is fed into a ""visual servoing"" control loop:

Steering (Yaw): The loop calculates the ball's horizontal position (x coordinate) in the frame. If the ball is not in the center, it sends a yaw (turn) command to the robot to steer left or right until the ball is centered.

Movement (Forward): The loop simultaneously checks the size of the ball's bounding box. If the ball is small (far away), it commands the robot to walk forward. As the robot gets closer, the ball appears larger, and the robot slows down, stopping when it reaches a target distance.

This creates a complete, closed-loop perception-to-action system that allows the robot to ""lock on"" and autonomously follow its target.",EAS 563,Includes a demo,,Atharva Prabhu - aprabhu5@buffalo.edu

11/16/2025 17:08:13,pdamle@buffalo.edu,A Conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) for Subject-level Concentration–Time Curve Reconstruction,"In this project, we worked on predicting a patient’s drug concentration–time profile using deep generative models. After testing traditional methods like SVMs and mixed-effects models, we designed a conditional VAE that captures the nonlinear PK behavior missing in simpler models. The model not only produced far more accurate reconstructions but also learned interpretable latent patterns linked to patient covariates. This helped create a reliable tool for generating full PK curves with uncertainty estimates.",Independent Study / Research,Poster Only,,"Prathamesh Damle - pdamle@buffalo.edu, Kishore Nandigram - knandiga@buffalo.edu"

11/18/2025 11:57:07,jfmontuo@buffalo.edu,Using Data to Draw on CD,"There have been attempts to draw on optical discs, specifically CD’s, using the data written to them. These attempts were recorded online but do not provide specifics on data computation, the methods of determining these processes, and an explanation of their final implementation. On top of this, when first using the implementations we were unable to produce the same results they yielded, or determine the constraints to produce the correct result.

For this project, we determined how to draw on a CD using data and document the process so that it is reproducible, such that if someone in the future wants to build upon our findings they can. We did so by reverse engineering the existing implementations and contributing our own versions.

11/24/2025 15:49:35,holdenwo@buffalo.edu,Application Layer Security for Wi-Fi Sensing,"IEEE 802.11bf is an amendment to the Wi-Fi standard that enables “Wi-Fi sensing” which allows devices to use Wi-Fi signals to sense information about the environment as opposed to the traditional use of transmitting data. Such applications include motion detection, presence sensing, gesture recognition, and more. It does this by utilizing channel state information to determine changes to the environment.

Security and privacy is an open issue with this standard alongside being able to coexist with regular Wi-Fi communication. The aim for the project at this time is to showcase the research done this semester into potential solutions to privacy and security, discussing the performance, security, and ease of implementation of various methods.",Independent Study / Research,Poster Only,,Roshan Ayyalasomayajula - roshana@buffalo.edu
