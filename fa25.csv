Four ML tasks were implemented at scale, sentiment classification with Linear SVM, helpful-vote prediction using Poisson regression, reviewer segmentation via K-Means, and extractive multi-review summarization using Random Forest regression with transformer-based features, producing robust insights and scalable models for understanding book reviews at large scale.", CSE587: Data Intensive Computing,Includes a demo,,"Anushka Ghei - aghei@buffalo.edu, Srishthi Priya - srishthi@buffalo.edu, Odra Bira - odrabira@buffalo.edu, Antariksha Dhanure - adhanure@buffalo.edu"
11/21/2025 21:29:52,dishitar@buffalo.edu,Unfold Studio,"Unfold Studio is a free, web-based learning platform created to support students who find coding intimidating or lack access to programs that teach it, as many existing platforms are too technical or not designed for beginners and social science learners. This creates a barrier for students who could benefit from coding as a way to express creativity and build programming skills. Educators also lack tools to understand or observe how students are using AI, and many students are copy-pasting from AI platforms instead of learning how to think through problems or write on their own. Unfold Studio provides a low pressure, creative environment where students can experiment and gradually learn coding concepts while developing logic and problem-solving skills. The platform combines storytelling, coding, and AI, and students stay in control of when and how AI supports them. It is designed for students and educators in multiple fields, including social sciences, CS, and middle and high school learners, with a primary focus on introductory CS courses. Its flexibility also allows educators in English, Social Studies, and CS to use it for interdisciplinary learning across different fields.",CSE 302/303/402,Includes a demo,https://unfoldstudio.net/,"Dishita Reddy Patil - dishitar@buffalo.edu, Aria Mahbub Orni - ariaorni@buffalo.edu, Ziang Chen - Ziangche@buffalo.edu, Andrea Kyaw - Andreaky@buffalo.edu"

The robot runs a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and track the ball's position in real-time from its camera feed. This vision data is fed into a ""visual servoing"" control loop:

Steering (Yaw): The loop calculates the ball's horizontal position (x coordinate) in the frame. If the ball is not in the center, it sends a yaw (turn) command to the robot to steer left or right until the ball is centered.

Movement (Forward): The loop simultaneously checks the size of the ball's bounding box. If the ball is small (far away), it commands the robot to walk forward. As the robot gets closer, the ball appears larger, and the robot slows down, stopping when it reaches a target distance.

This creates a complete, closed-loop perception-to-action system that allows the robot to ""lock on"" and autonomously follow its target.",EAS 563,Includes a demo,,Atharva Prabhu - aprabhu5@buffalo.edu

EDA techniques—including correlation analysis, boxplots, scatter plots, and trend visualizations—were used to uncover relationships and outliers in the dataset. After preprocessing the data with Spark pipelines (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and assembling feature vectors), a Random Forest regression model was trained, evaluated, and improved through hyperparameter tuning.

12/2/2025 21:26:10,tanviran@buffalo.edu,CityLearn-DR: A Multi-Hazard RL Benchmark for Disaster-Ready Grid Control,"Modern reinforcement learning benchmarks for building energy management
assume stable operating conditions, even though real distribution systems face
rare but severe shocks from climate extremes and malicious grid disruptions.
This gap raises a fundamental question: can an RL controller learn resilience-
aware behavior when exposed to stochastic multi-hazard disturbances with advance
warning signals. We address this by introducing a disaster-augmented variant
of the CityLearn Challenge 2022 Phase 1 environment that models snowstorms,
heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes, and grid attacks through dynamic modifications
to load, solar generation, and grid availability. The state representation is extended
with hazard type, warning indicators, and time-to-event features, and we train
a centralized Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) controller using an urgency-
weighted objective that prioritizes continuity of supply during hazard periods.
In one-year rollouts containing three major disaster events totaling 288 hazard-
hours (72-hour winter storm, 120-hour heatwave, 96-hour wildfire), the learned
policy maintains a long-run average battery state of charge of 51.8 percent despite
sustained discharge during outages, raises SOC proactively in advance of hazard
windows, and limits unserved energy to 3.42 kWh per disaster-hour, outperforming
random and rule-based baselines while preserving peak-demand reductions. These
results show that integrating disaster forecasts directly into the control loop enables
RL controllers to internalize temporal risk structure and develop proactive resilience
