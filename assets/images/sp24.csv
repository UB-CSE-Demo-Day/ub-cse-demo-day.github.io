While, this is great news for indoor automation, there are deployability concerns in terms of generalizability and privacy concerns surrounding it. While, the most popular approach is to use data based ML-models to provide sub-meter accurate localization algorithms, there are still requirements for generalization to different environments and better accuracy.

We developed a web-app to get data from Wi-Fi routers for a given smartphone. The data is then to be processed online to pass through an ML-model. We also developed an android app that can allow us to navigate within the first and third floors of the Davis Hall.",CSE 302/303,https://webdev.cse.buffalo.edu/elr/sp24/#indoor-wireless-localization-roshan-ayyalasomayajula,"Wireless Systems, Wi-Fi Localization, Android Studio (Kotlin), MQTT, Docker Containers.","Anthony Szykowny - ahszykow@buffalo.edu, Christopher Varghese - cgvarghe@buffalo.edu, Matthew Cheung - cheung44@buffalo.edu, Dora Lei - doralei@buffalo.edu, Sydney Chan - schan48@buffalo.edu, Ashton Hannon - athannon@buffalo.edu"
