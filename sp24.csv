However, I then prove theoretically that there does exist a transformer architecture capable of modeling LEM, suggesting that current training procedures and/or the structure (i.e. lack thereof) of purely textual data may be insufficient for transformers to inductively learn LEM.

1. Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a responsive design that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
2. Backend: Python and Flask for server-side logic, handling API requests, and serving the web pages.
3. Deep Learning: Deep learning model for training of dataset and sign classification.
4. Computer Vision: Mediapipe and OpenCV for sign detection.
5. Cloud: Deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to ensure scalability and high availability.","Manasi Jadhav - mjadhav@buffalo.edu, Sneha Singh - singh43@buffalo.edu, Sneha Yadav - snehayad@buffalo.edu"
