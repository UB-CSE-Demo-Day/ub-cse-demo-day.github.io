However, I then prove theoretically that there does exist a transformer architecture capable of modeling LEM, suggesting that current training procedures and/or the structure (i.e. lack thereof) of purely textual data may be insufficient for transformers to inductively learn LEM.

This seamless integration of AI not only allows users to receive real-time damage evaluations but also enables them to interact directly with our chatbot for various roadside assistance services, such as calling for instant help, on-the-spot repairs, or towing. Each user creates a personal account on our portal, ensuring a personalized and secure experience. Once damage is reported and assessed, users can engage with the chatbot to generate detailed assessment reports and initiate contact with nearby affiliated repair shops for prompt service, all through the SAARTHI application.

Beyond its technical capabilities, SAARTHI offers significant benefits by enhancing transparency and efficiency in the automotive repair and insurance sectors. Users are protected from inflated charges with a trustworthy, independent assessment, aiding them in navigating the complexities of car repair and insurance claims. Additionally, the system streamlines operations for insurance companies by reducing reliance on manual inspections, which can be time-consuming and occasionally inaccurate.

1. Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a responsive design that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
2. Backend: Python and Flask for server-side logic, handling API requests, and serving the web pages.
3. Deep Learning: Deep learning model for training of dataset and sign classification.
4. Computer Vision: Mediapipe and OpenCV for sign detection.
5. Cloud: Deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to ensure scalability and high availability.","Manasi Jadhav - mjadhav@buffalo.edu, Sneha Singh - singh43@buffalo.edu, Sneha Yadav - snehayad@buffalo.edu"
