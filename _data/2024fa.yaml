      widespread, there is an active Task Group 802.11bf as well to bring this into
      standards and there are many learning based solutions to bring localization
      accuracy to sub-meter level. While, this is great news for indoor automation,
      there are deployability concerns in terms of generalizability and privacy concerns
      surrounding it. While, the most popular approach is to use data based ML-models
      to provide sub-meter accurate localization algorithms, there are still requirements
      for generalization to different environments and better accuracy.


      During the first semester, the students will develop a web-app to get data from
      Wi-Fi routers for a given smartphone. The data is then to be processed online
      to pass through an ML-model. While, there is a baseline ML-model, they should
      develop and improve the generalizability and accuracy of the localization algorithm
      (which would be almost similar to object detection problems). The next stage
      of the project would be to develop quantifiable differential privacy for these
      learning models, by adding quantifiable noise to the input images.'

      portant as online platforms rely heavily on user-generated content

      to influence consumer decisions. Fake reviews can distort public

      perception, undermine trust in services, and mislead potential

      a robust AI system that accurately detects and interprets emotions from diverse
      data streams, including video, audio, and facial expressions. Leveraging advances
      in deep learning and multimodal fusion techniques, this project integrates visual
      cues from facial expressions, auditory signals like tone and pitch, and contextual
      video content to recognize and classify emotional states more effectively than
      single-modal approaches. The model combines features from each modality, using
      specialized architectures such as CNNs for facial analysis, LSTMs or transformers
      for temporal sequences in video and audio, and multimodal attention mechanisms
      to weigh the importance of each input. By fusing these data streams, the project
      aims to enhance emotion recognition accuracy and provide insights into real-time
      applications, such as improving human-computer interactions, video content analysis,
      and mental health monitoring.

      from the success of exploration-focused algorithms like Random Network Distillation

  - description: 'Our Project we are presenting is DiffReg, a novel diffusion-based
      method for 3D point cloud registration. Inspired by diffusion models, DiffReg
      iteratively refines the predicted correspondences between two point clouds by
      progressively denoising their coordinates. This approach achieves state-of-the-art
      performance on both ModelNet and 3DMatch.

  - description: 'We have Built a movie recommendation engine using Reinforcement
      Learning Algorithms ( DDPG) that leverages user and movie embeddings, genre
      preferences, and reinforcement learning to personalize recommendations dynamically.

      Traditional recommendation systems rely on static collaborative filtering or
      content-based techniques. Incorporating reinforcement learning improves adaptability
      and decision-making by actively optimizing recommendations for user satisfaction.
