      patrons to participate in a scavenger hunt application. The patrons would be
      given a challenging set of scavenger hunt questions, they would have to find
      the exhibit that satisfies the answer to the question and scan a near field
      communications (NFC) chip with their smartphone to get credit for answering
      the question. The application would time the execution of the scavenger hunt
      and patrons will see their ranking at the end of the scavenger hunt. A companion
      objective is to develop an administrative application to load and maintain the
      scavenger hunt information, narrative, photos, etc. for consumption by the patron
      application. The senior design class will be responsible for defining the project
      requirements, creating a comprehensive plan, and overseeing its development
      and deployment

  - description: This project aims to create a toolchain based around a compiler and
      machine learning classifier to identify Android and Java malware.  Students
      will work on modifying an existing compiler (Soot) to analyze Java and Android
      programs.  The project will involved writing static and dynamic analyses to
      identify features that can be used by a classifier to make a determination if
      a given program is malicious or not. The project will begin with students learning
      about and writing their own intra-procedural information flow analysis.  Students
      will then extend their intra-procedural information flow analysis to be a whole
      program inter-procedural information flow analysis.  This analysis will identify
      the portion of the computation that deals with sensitive and personal data.
      Students will then write an analysis over this portion of the code to extract
      features to be used for classification.  The analyses can be extended to handle
      more complex Java and Android features like reflection and Android IPC mechanisms.
      There is also room for exploring different machine learning technologies based
      on performance and accuracy measures.

      Face recognition, a cornerstone of early deep learning methodologies, has become
      a pivotal technology in AI systems, raising concerns regarding privacy and security
      in widespread applications. Face embeddings, though essential for identity verification,
      have been shown to be susceptible to leaks, enabling unauthorized access and
      unintended information extraction. This research investigates existing template
      protection techniques and their effectiveness in preventing biometric information
      leaks. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in many existing techniques, emphasizing
      the need for enhanced privacy safeguards. To address this, we propose a novel
      dual-layer protection method for face embeddings, combining established protection
      schemes with an additional encryption layer to fortify privacy. The use of Fully
      Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables secure analytics on encrypted templates.

      Our approach successfully circumvents the shortcomings of individual protection
      techniques, providing an elevated level of privacy and security. We demonstrate
      the effectiveness of our method through face verification, age, gender and ethnicity
      prediction tasks, achieving comparable performance to unprotected templates.
      Leveraging FHE alongside conventional protection methods ensures irreversibility
      and unlinkability, preserving accuracy while eliminating the risk of biometric
      information leaks. The project presents comprehensive results supporting the
      efficacy of our proposed approach in advancing the privacy and security landscape
      of face recognition systems.'
