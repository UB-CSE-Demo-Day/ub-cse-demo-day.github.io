  - description: This project is about developing a plant watering robot. The goal
      is for the robot to water household plants autonomously. It should explore the
      unknown environment and build a map, and scan for possible candidate targets
      (plants) at the same time. It should validate the data with the user, through
      a friendly interface. Once the map is finalized, the robot should be able to
      navigate in the map and reach the plants avoiding obstacles, then water them
      according to the user's preferences.

      make food eating/preparing a social and fun experience. By providing a Tinder-style
      interface, filtering options, and the ability to add/share food images, recipes
      and restaurant info, the app will help users in decision making easier and discovering
      new recipes to prepare together from their homes.

  - description: "We created the IBM digital health diary, a smartphone app for tracking\
      \ health, to assist users in performing routine health assessments and monitoring\
      \ their progress over time. Flutter was implemented for the front-end, and Nodejs\
      \ ,MongoDB and APIs were used for the back-development. It \_has additional\
      \ features including the ability to update tasks on a calendar, provide analytics\
      \ in the form of charts and plots, retrieve results according to date or task,\
      \ and provide context for where a given result falls on the scale. Overall,\
      \ a Digital Health Diary can provide patients with a convenient and accessible\
      \ way to manage their health and help healthcare providers deliver more effective\
      \ and personalized care."
