  - description: Unfold Studio is a free, web-based learning platform created to support
      students who find coding intimidating or lack access to programs that teach
      it, as many existing platforms are too technical or not designed for beginners
      and social science learners. This creates a barrier for students who could benefit
      from coding as a way to express creativity and build programming skills. Educators
      also lack tools to understand or observe how students are using AI, and many
      students are copy-pasting from AI platforms instead of learning how to think
      through problems or write on their own. Unfold Studio provides a low pressure,
      creative environment where students can experiment and gradually learn coding
      concepts while developing logic and problem-solving skills. The platform combines
      storytelling, coding, and AI, and students stay in control of when and how AI
      supports them. It is designed for students and educators in multiple fields,
      including social sciences, CS, and middle and high school learners, with a primary
      focus on introductory CS courses. Its flexibility also allows educators in English,
      Social Studies, and CS to use it for interdisciplinary learning across different
      fields.

      images that display directly on the physical LED panels. The website also includes
      controls to start and stop the LED Video Wall remotely. These additions highlight

      the LED system, creating an intuitive and engaging user experience.

      essential. This project introduces an AI-powered Radiology Chatbot that integrates
      retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), image captioning, and summarization to
      support clinical decision-making. The system processes DICOM chest X-ray images
      and free-text radiology reports from the Indiana University OpenI dataset, enabling
      multi-turn, context-aware conversations with clinicians. Using semantic embeddings
      and FAISS indexing, it retrieves the most relevant report sections and metadata
      to enrich query responses. A BART-based summarization module generates concise
      and clinically coherent report summaries for quick reference. The chatbot is
      deployed through a Streamlit interface that supports both chat-based Q&A and
      one-click summarization. Overall, this system aims to streamline radiology workflows,
      enhance interpretability, and improve accessibility of diagnostic insights for
      healthcare professionals.

  - description: 'This project enables the Unitree Go 2 robot to autonomously find
      and move towards a target ball (green, pink, or yellow) using its onboard vision.


      The robot runs a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and track the ball''s
      position in real-time from its camera feed. This vision data is fed into a "visual
      servoing" control loop:


      Steering (Yaw): The loop calculates the ball''s horizontal position (x coordinate)
      in the frame. If the ball is not in the center, it sends a yaw (turn) command
      to the robot to steer left or right until the ball is centered.


      Movement (Forward): The loop simultaneously checks the size of the ball''s bounding
      box. If the ball is small (far away), it commands the robot to walk forward.
      As the robot gets closer, the ball appears larger, and the robot slows down,
      stopping when it reaches a target distance.


      This creates a complete, closed-loop perception-to-action system that allows
      the robot to "lock on" and autonomously follow its target.'
