  - description: This project builds a complete end-to-end big-data analytics pipeline
      to process and analyze the multi-million record Amazon Books Reviews dataset
      using Pandas, PySpark, and machine learning. The workflow includes extensive
      data cleaning, distributed preprocessing, and exploratory analysis of review
      patterns such as rating distributions, review lengths, and reviewer behavior.
      Four ML tasks were implemented at scale, sentiment classification with Linear
      SVM, helpful-vote prediction using Poisson regression, reviewer segmentation
      via K-Means, and extractive multi-review summarization using Random Forest regression
      with transformer-based features, producing robust insights and scalable models
      for understanding book reviews at large scale.

  - description: Unfold Studio is a free, web-based learning platform created to support
      students who find coding intimidating or lack access to programs that teach
      it, as many existing platforms are too technical or not designed for beginners
      and social science learners. This creates a barrier for students who could benefit
      from coding as a way to express creativity and build programming skills. Educators
      also lack tools to understand or observe how students are using AI, and many
      students are copy-pasting from AI platforms instead of learning how to think
      through problems or write on their own. Unfold Studio provides a low pressure,
      creative environment where students can experiment and gradually learn coding
      concepts while developing logic and problem-solving skills. The platform combines
      storytelling, coding, and AI, and students stay in control of when and how AI
      supports them. It is designed for students and educators in multiple fields,
      including social sciences, CS, and middle and high school learners, with a primary
      focus on introductory CS courses. Its flexibility also allows educators in English,
      Social Studies, and CS to use it for interdisciplinary learning across different
      fields.

      by a previous group, adding several new interactive features. We created a web-based
      interface that allows users to easily control the system, including uploading
      images that display directly on the physical LED panels. The website also includes
      controls to start and stop the LED Video Wall remotely. These additions highlight
      a seamless connection between the web interface and the microcontrollers powering
      the LED system, creating an intuitive and engaging user experience.

      The robot runs a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and track the ball''s
      position in real-time from its camera feed. This vision data is fed into a "visual
      servoing" control loop:


      Steering (Yaw): The loop calculates the ball''s horizontal position (x coordinate)
      in the frame. If the ball is not in the center, it sends a yaw (turn) command
      to the robot to steer left or right until the ball is centered.


      Movement (Forward): The loop simultaneously checks the size of the ball''s bounding
      box. If the ball is small (far away), it commands the robot to walk forward.
      As the robot gets closer, the ball appears larger, and the robot slows down,
      stopping when it reaches a target distance.


      This creates a complete, closed-loop perception-to-action system that allows
      the robot to "lock on" and autonomously follow its target.'

      and FAISS indexing, it retrieves the most relevant report sections and metadata

      system that enhances speech clarity by combining both audio and visual information.
      Building on my work from CSE 676: Deep Learning, I utilize the CleanUNet audio
      backbone and integrate lip movement analysis using MediaPipe Face Mesh to provide
      visual context that helps separate speech from background noise. My goal from
      this project is to create a more intelligible speech enhancement model that
      performs even in noisy, real-world environments. '

      \ and document the process so that it is reproducible, such that if someone\
      \ in the future wants to build upon our findings they can. We did so by reverse\

  - description: 'Modern reinforcement learning benchmarks for building energy management

      assume stable operating conditions, even though real distribution systems face

      rare but severe shocks from climate extremes and malicious grid disruptions.

      This gap raises a fundamental question: can an RL controller learn resilience-

      aware behavior when exposed to stochastic multi-hazard disturbances with advance

      warning signals. We address this by introducing a disaster-augmented variant

      of the CityLearn Challenge 2022 Phase 1 environment that models snowstorms,

      heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes, and grid attacks through dynamic modifications

      to load, solar generation, and grid availability. The state representation is
      extended

      with hazard type, warning indicators, and time-to-event features, and we train

      a centralized Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) controller using an urgency-

      weighted objective that prioritizes continuity of supply during hazard periods.

      In one-year rollouts containing three major disaster events totaling 288 hazard-

      hours (72-hour winter storm, 120-hour heatwave, 96-hour wildfire), the learned

      policy maintains a long-run average battery state of charge of 51.8 percent
      despite

      sustained discharge during outages, raises SOC proactively in advance of hazard

      windows, and limits unserved energy to 3.42 kWh per disaster-hour, outperforming

      random and rule-based baselines while preserving peak-demand reductions. These

      results show that integrating disaster forecasts directly into the control loop
      enables

      RL controllers to internalize temporal risk structure and develop proactive
      resilience

      strategies rather than reactive responses.'
