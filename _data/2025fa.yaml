  - description: 'My project focuses on developing a multi-modal speech denoising
      system that enhances speech clarity by combining both audio and visual information.
      Building on my work from CSE 676: Deep Learning, I utilize the CleanUNet audio
      backbone and integrate lip movement analysis using MediaPipe Face Mesh to provide
      visual context that helps separate speech from background noise. My goal from
      this project is to create a more intelligible speech enhancement model that
      performs even in noisy, real-world environments. '

      \ and document the process so that it is reproducible, such that if someone\
      \ in the future wants to build upon our findings they can. We did so by reverse\

  - description: Radiology departments are experiencing growing workloads as the number
      of chest X-rays continues to rise, making rapid and accurate interpretation
      essential. This project introduces an AI-powered Radiology Chatbot that integrates
      retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), image captioning, and summarization to
      support clinical decision-making. The system processes DICOM chest X-ray images
      and free-text radiology reports from the Indiana University OpenI dataset, enabling
      multi-turn, context-aware conversations with clinicians. Using semantic embeddings
      and FAISS indexing, it retrieves the most relevant report sections and metadata
      to enrich query responses. A BART-based summarization module generates concise
      and clinically coherent report summaries for quick reference. The chatbot is
      deployed through a Streamlit interface that supports both chat-based Q&A and
      one-click summarization. Overall, this system aims to streamline radiology workflows,
      enhance interpretability, and improve accessibility of diagnostic insights for
      healthcare professionals.

  - description: 'This project enables the Unitree Go 2 robot to autonomously find
      and move towards a target ball (green, pink, or yellow) using its onboard vision.


      The robot runs a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and track the ball''s
      position in real-time from its camera feed. This vision data is fed into a "visual
      servoing" control loop:


      Steering (Yaw): The loop calculates the ball''s horizontal position (x coordinate)
      in the frame. If the ball is not in the center, it sends a yaw (turn) command
      to the robot to steer left or right until the ball is centered.


      Movement (Forward): The loop simultaneously checks the size of the ball''s bounding
      box. If the ball is small (far away), it commands the robot to walk forward.
      As the robot gets closer, the ball appears larger, and the robot slows down,
      stopping when it reaches a target distance.


      This creates a complete, closed-loop perception-to-action system that allows
      the robot to "lock on" and autonomously follow its target.'
