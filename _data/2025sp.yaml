  - description: 'Project Description

      This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic monitoring system that analyzes
      live camera feeds to detect and classify anomalies in traffic patterns. The
      system will learn normal traffic behavior over time and identify deviations
      that represent anomalous conditions such as accidents, congestion, vehicle breakdowns,
      or unusual driving patterns.


      Unlike traditional traffic monitoring systems that only detect the presence
      of anomalies, our approach will further classify these anomalies into specific
      categories (e.g., flow-based anomalies like congestion, behavioral anomalies
      like erratic driving, infrastructural anomalies like road hazards, and environmental
      anomalies like weather impacts). This classification capability will enable
      more targeted responses from traffic management systems.


      The project leverages recent advances in deep learning, particularly combining
      convolutional neural networks for object detection with graph neural networks
      and LSTM architectures to capture spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data.
      By processing real-time video feeds from traffic cameras, our system will provide
      actionable insights that can help reduce congestion, improve emergency response
      times, and enhance overall traffic management efficiency.


      Our implementation will focus on balancing detection accuracy with real-time
      processing requirements, ensuring the system can operate effectively in various
      environmental conditions and traffic scenarios.'

  - description: 'The project aims to build a real-time Sign Language Recognition
      system using OpenCV. The goal is to recognize both static hand gestures (such
      as American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets A-Z) and dynamic gestures (i.e., gestures
      involving movement across frames or signing complete words like "Hello" or "Thanks")
      from a live video feed captured via a webcam.

      This system will process video frames in real-time, detect the user''s hand,
      and classify the gesture using a trained model. For static gestures, a Convolutional
      Neural Network (CNN) will be used. For dynamic gestures, the project will integrate
      sequence modeling techniques such as RNNs or Transformer-based architectures
      to analyze temporal patterns across sequences of frames.'

      civilization. The names of the main prehistoric phases of human history, e.g.,
      the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, etc., are the testimony to this statement.
      The progress has been paralleled by a better understanding of the relationship
      between (micro)structure and material properties that led to the plethora of
      materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, LEDs, graphene, organic semiconductors).
      In recent years, progress in materials research has been fueled by machine learning
      (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). To streamline the transition, the information
      about the materials'' structure needs to be converted into an ML-readable format.
      GraSPI is a software developed at UB that featurizes the micrographs into an
      array of physically meaningful descriptors that can be directly used in ML pipeline.


      In this project, students will enhance an existing GraSPI project. GraSPI uses
      a graph/network as a data structure to efficiently calculate descriptors from
      materials micrographs. The project''s current version is coded in C/C++ using
      the boost library. This project aims to translate the current implementation
      to be python-native (e.g., using NetworkX) or use a boost.Python library. Part
      of the project will be: - to identify the best strategy for the needed translation
      (research solution, plan and execute the basic tests with classic graph-based
      algorithms, and make the suggestion); - plan the translation between two packages
      - implement the Python packages (core functionality, documentation, example
      notebooks)'

      IoT settings like smart warehouses using multiple reinforcement learning techniques.
      We built a 10x10 grid simulation where multiple readers pick frequency and time
      slots while avoiding interference, signal jammers, and shifting traffic. The
      setup is designed keeping in mind the real-world challenges with added randomness
      and traffic variations. We completed testing on five RL strategies: the original
      HiQ Q-learning, our custom Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, and Double DQN. Each agent
      is made to learn to minimize collisions and maximize successful tag reads through
      smart frequency-slot selection.'

  - description: This project improves clinical trust in Bayesian medical image segmentation
      by aligning uncertainty with actual errors. AvU loss is applied to segmentation
      tasks, a rarely explored direction in medical AI. Simulated rater disagreement
      approximates aleatoric uncertainty without requiring costly multi-rater datasets.
      Both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties are unified into a simple, demo-friendly
      framework. The resulting uncertainty maps are designed to hold real clinical
      significance, beyond being mere visual artifacts.

  - description: This project automates the negotiation process between buyer and
      seller agents using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. This
      project helps to meed the need for an intelligent solution that can simulate
      human-like bargaining behavior, adjust offers in real time, and maximize mutual
      benefit between negotiating parties without manual intervention. Each agent
      is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leveraging self-play to
      dynamically evolve negotiation strategies over alternating offers and counteroffers.
      By simulating real-world negotiation dynamics, the system aims to build adaptive,
      scalable, and efficient autonomous negotiators capable of handling complex and
      evolving deal-making environments. Negotiations are formulated as a sequential
      decision-making process with bounded action spaces, where agents alternately
      propose and counter-propose offers.The use of clipped surrogate objectives in
      PPO ensures stable policy updates under the non-stationary dynamics of multi-agent
      learning. The system is designed to enable adaptive and rational negotiation
      strategies applicable to domains such as e-commerce pricing, automated trading,
      B2B deal-making, and resource allocation systems.
