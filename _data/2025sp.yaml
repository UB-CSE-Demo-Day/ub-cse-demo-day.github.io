  - description: Kaleida Health App 4.0 primarily focuses on improving communication
      between patients and family, helping patients and their families follow their
      medical journey, having physician teams provide customized information on diagnosis
      for patients, and most importantly, decreasing patient anxiety about the hospitalization
      process.

  - description: We propose a library in Golang to for parallelized homomorphic cosine
      similarity operations. To demonstrate our implementation we also present Blind
      Match. A Fuzzy Private set intersection protocol to efficiently compare encrypted
      entity data using TF-IDF vectors while preserving privacy. To reduce the computational
      cost of homomorphic encryption, we exploit the sparsity of n-gram TF-IDF vectors
      and apply com- pression techniques that maintain cosine similarity, such as
      Fourier and Orthonormal Wavelet Transforms. Our project leverages the CKKS encryption
      scheme for secure dot product computations and is developed as an open-source
      Go Implementation

  - description: This project focuses on integrating Sharpness-Aware Minimization
      into Multi-task learning. We propose a lightweight Sharpness-Aware Multi-task
      Optimization (SAMO) approach, which combines the benefits of Global Information
      (G-SAM) and Local Information(L-SAM) to mitigate task conflicts while keeping
      the computational cost manageable. The effectiveness of our approach was then
      validated with extensive experiments on different datasets (NYUv2, Cityscapes,
      QM9, Office-Home).

      \ the early progression of Alzheimer\xE2\u20AC\u2122s Disease by modeling causal\
      \ relationships between key biomarkers and genetic risk factors like APOE4.\
      \ Using a nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modeling framework inspired by physiologically-based\
      \ pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, the project captures individual biomarker trajectories\
      \ (e.g., ABETA, TAU, PTAU) over time. By leveraging the ADNI dataset and integrating\
      \ longitudinal data in long format, the model simulates disease progression\
      \ and identifies early indicators of cognitive decline. This approach enables\
      \ a deeper understanding of disease onset mechanisms and has potential applications\
      \ in personalized early diagnosis and treatment planning."

  - description: We present ActDiffNet, a novel active learning framework for affective
      state recognition using multisensor biosignals. The model addresses key challenges
      in biomedical machine learning, such as data scarcity and class imbalance, by
      synthesizing hard-to-learn minority patterns using conditional diffusion models.
      ActDiffNet starts with minimal labeled data and iteratively improves through
      targeted synthetic signal generation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
      on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing supervised and self-supervised
      models. This research is accepted for publication at the IEEE CHASE 2025 conference.
