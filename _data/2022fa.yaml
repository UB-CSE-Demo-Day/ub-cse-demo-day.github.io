      quality, scalability, and ease of use. It will soon be possible to mass produce
      highly realistic synthetic content that may be generated and spread faster than
      fake media detectors can manage. The proliferation of these technologies poses
      clear threats to society and democracy (for example, consider the dangers of
      shared videos wherein politicians give fake speeches). It appears that the future
      of information channels which we rely on when forming our beliefs and opinions,
      is on the shaky ground unless detection technology can gain the upper hand.
      Synthetic audio detection is one key element in managing this threat.

  - description: 'Metagenomic classification is a form of DNA analysis that aims to
      classify organisms based on their DNA fragments present in a biological sample.
      The recent introduction of portable DNA sequencers has fostered great interest
      in performing metagenomic classification in mobile settings, motivated by applications
      such as rapid medical diagnosis, detection and tracking of infectious diseases,
      automated bioterrorism response systems, monitoring dynamic microbial communities,
      and more. However, the software to perform metagenomic classification remains
      incompatible with mobile workflows. Metagenomic classification is extremely
      resource intensive in terms of compute, memory, energy, network, and storage,
      and typical tools are designed to operate in large data centers, on supercomputers,
      and in the cloud, whose resources far outclass those available to mobile devices.
      Despite the advancements in portable DNA sequencing technology, the question
      of how to design software systems for metagenomics that are capable of mobile
      deployments remains wholly unanswered.


      In this project, we introduces Coriolis, a metagenomic classifier designed from
      the ground up to be efficient in mobile environments. Coriolis is based on novel
      programming abstractions and data structures that enable efficient management
      of scarce resources on mobile devices. These programming abstractions are packaged
      in the form of SMARTEn, a programming model and framework for expressing metagenomic
      classification algorithms. SMARTEn decomposes the metagenomic classification
      process into individual tasks, opening up opportunities to automatically manage
      and optimize their execution at runtime. To manage the massive reference database
      of known genomes required for metagnomic classification, we introduce the compact
      string B-tree (CSBT) as a practical data structure for managing unstructured
      text on disk. The CSBT is a space-efficient and generalized variant of (Ferragina
      and Grossi, 1999)''s string B-tree (SBT). At a high level, the CSBT can be thought
      of as a B+-tree of suffix offsets where each node''s key set is represented
      as a suffix array augmented with information on the mismatched characters between
      adjacent suffixes. We prove that this information is sufficient to identify
      a query string''s rank in a CSBT node while performing only a single disk access,
      and we give an I/O optimal algorithm for finding all occurrences of the longest
      matching prefix of a pattern in the text. The resulting representation is an
      order of magnitude smaller than the SBT, resulting in far better throughput
      and space usage. Furthermore, additional techniques enable the CSBT to index
      multiple texts while eliminating the need to store duplicate information, significantly
      improving performance for practical applications. Rigorous theoretical and experimental
      analysis demonstrates that Coriolis outperforms the state-of-the-art and enables
      real-time in the field metagenomics.'

      the enormous number of vulnerabilities with such IoT devices. Therefore, it
      is crucial to understand and detect the IoT malware remote infection before

      a study on a large-scale dataset covering 403,464 IoT malware samples with a
      deep insight into the IoT malware remote infection characteristics. Furthermore,
      to realize the early detection of remote infection, they developed an infection
      detector to monitor ongoing remote infection activities based on the infection
      capabilities. With deploying the infection detector on the software IoT honeypots
      for almost one year, they detected  147,860 remote infections with a 99.22%

      Furthermore, we conduct two novel experiments to understand the relationship

      to new types of hateful memes (average F1-score of only 0.2), give significantly
      more importance to the visual modality during prediction (about 2X higher average
      importance than textual modality), and that the textual modality actually provides
      significantly greater valid information to detect new types of hateful memes.

      our airspace should be a top concern for all of us. Air Traffic Control is time-consuming
      and laborious due to the human element. Therefore, the automation of such a
      process is much needed. Utilizing advanced reinforcement learning methods (PPO),
      we have created a model which allows for automated traffic control of many agents
      so that they reach their destinations without conflict in a timely manner.

      Reinforcement Learning (a branch of machine learning where agents are trained

      automating the refugee resettlement process. The problem is generally modeled
      as a bipartite matching between families and locations with two-sided preferences
      as well as demand and capacity constraints for a set of services. Researchers
      have proposed several algorithmic solutions, each claiming to improve efficiency
      or welfare in some aspect. The goal of this study is to evaluate and offer a
      comprehensive comparison of three such algorithms. Further, we show that each
      algorithm is susceptible to capacity manipulation, a form of strategic behavior
      where locations can improve their outcomes by misreporting their capacity constraints.
