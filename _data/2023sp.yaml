  - description: This project is about developing a plant watering robot. The goal
      is for the robot to water household plants autonomously. It should explore the
      unknown environment and build a map, and scan for possible candidate targets
      (plants) at the same time. It should validate the data with the user, through
      a friendly interface. Once the map is finalized, the robot should be able to
      navigate in the map and reach the plants avoiding obstacles, then water them
      according to the user's preferences.

      \ features including the ability to update tasks on a calendar, provide analytics\
      \ in the form of charts and plots, retrieve results according to date or task,\
      \ and provide context for where a given result falls on the scale. Overall,\

      or maybe even weeks. If the model run is interrupted or crashed, a lot of data,
      time, and effort might be lost. In order to prevent that, we can checkpoint
      our models during training. This enables us to take a snapshot of the model
      to prevent data loss of the entire run in case of failure. This will allow us
      to restart the training from the latest checkpoint. This can be further optimized
      by making the checkpoint mechanism real-time. We write the updated embedded
      tables continuously to a log system like Kafka.

      \ real-world racing on a physical track. By employing cameras to perceive the\
      \ track and using a reinforcement learning model to govern throttle and steering,\
      \ the car demonstrates how a model trained in a simulated environment can be\
      \ effectively deployed in the real world. Equipped with various sensors and\
      \ cameras, the AWS Deep Racer is capable of perceiving its surroundings, including\
      \ the layout of the track and any obstacles present. This data is then transmitted\
      \ to a reinforcement learning model, which utilizes it to compute the appropriate\
      \ steering and throttle commands for the car based on its current state and\
      \ the environmental conditions. Not only is the AWS Deep Racer an enjoyable\
      \ and interactive tool for gaining knowledge about autonomous driving and reinforcement\
      \ learning, but it also showcases the possible applications of RL in various\
      \ practical fields, including transportation, logistics, manufacturing,\_and\_\

  - description: 'In this research project, we investigate the efficacy of advanced
      exploration strategies and state space optimization techniques in reinforcement
      learning, specifically focusing on complex Atari game environments. By integrating
      the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm with Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), we aim
      to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off and improve AI agents'' performance
      in high-dimensional state spaces.


      Our methodology employs an encoder-decoder model to learn a compact representation
      of the high-dimensional Atari state space, allowing for more efficient state
      representation and action selection. We incorporate a multi-head attention mechanism
      in the model to reduce noise and focus on essential components of the state
      space, enhancing the model''s ability to learn relevant features and dependencies.
      By pre-training the encoder and freezing its weights during the training phase,
      we optimize the training process, reducing co-variate shift, accelerating convergence,
      and improving the model''s stability and performance.


      The results of our research demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced
      exploration strategies, such as UCB, with state space optimization techniques
      like multi-head attention and encoder-decoder models in enhancing reinforcement
      learning models'' performance in complex environments. This approach leads to
      more efficient training, higher reward returns, and increased adaptability of
      AI agents across various tasks and environments. Our findings contribute to
      the growing body of knowledge in reinforcement learning and have implications
      for the development of sophisticated AI agents capable of addressing a wide
      range of real-world challenges and applications.'
