  - description: This project is about developing a plant watering robot. The goal
      is for the robot to water household plants autonomously. It should explore the
      unknown environment and build a map, and scan for possible candidate targets
      (plants) at the same time. It should validate the data with the user, through
      a friendly interface. Once the map is finalized, the robot should be able to
      navigate in the map and reach the plants avoiding obstacles, then water them
      according to the user's preferences.

      \ features including the ability to update tasks on a calendar, provide analytics\
      \ in the form of charts and plots, retrieve results according to date or task,\
      \ and provide context for where a given result falls on the scale. Overall,\
      \ a Digital Health Diary can provide patients with a convenient and accessible\

      College students buy many things that they do not end up needing. Many of these
      things may be too trivial and unseen on sites like eBay, Facebook Marketplace,
      or Amazon. With Sixerr, a student can sell a carton of eggs they no longer want

      to trade for a jar of peanut butter. Anything goes (as long as it is safe and
