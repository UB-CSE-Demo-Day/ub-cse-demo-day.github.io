  - description: This research employs advanced machine learning and neural network
      models to analyze crime types, predict hotspots, and uncover latent topics within
      Los Angeles crime data. By integrating spatial, temporal, and textual analysis,
      it offers valuable insights for law enforcement on crime patterns and prevention
      strategies.

  - description: 'Indoor Wireless Localization (specifically Wi-Fi) has become quite
      widespread, there is an active Task Group 802.11bf as well to bring this into
      standards and there are many learning based solutions to bring localization
      accuracy to sub-meter level. While, this is great news for indoor automation,
      there are deployability concerns in terms of generalizability and privacy concerns
      surrounding it. While, the most popular approach is to use data based ML-models
      to provide sub-meter accurate localization algorithms, there are still requirements
      for generalization to different environments and better accuracy.


      We developed a web-app to get data from Wi-Fi routers for a given smartphone.
      The data is then to be processed online to pass through an ML-model. We also
      developed an android app that can allow us to navigate within the first and
      third floors of the Davis Hall.'
