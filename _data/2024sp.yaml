      Recipe Pantry is a social media application designed to assist those looking
      to share, receive, and search for recipes. Our app makes usability the utmost
      priority for the end of streamlining users towards discovering the recipes they''re
      going to be most interested in.


      The flames fueling the fire behind Recipe Pantry cook in Recipe Creation and
      Cookbook Curation. The former allows one to title a recipe, describe the ingredients
      and preparation steps therein, and to accompany it with an appetizing image.
      Cookbooks allow for the collation of recipes into a cohesive whole - say a collection
      of Latin cuisine, or perhaps Asian Fusion? Recipe Pantry grants the whole world
      of cuisine at an instant!'

      We developed a web-app to get data from Wi-Fi routers for a given smartphone.
      The data is then to be processed online to pass through an ML-model. We also

  - description: 'I show experimentally that: (i) transformer NLI models treat external
      negation as a distractor, and effectively ignore its presence in hypothesis
      sentences; (ii) several near-SoTA models fail to inductively learn the law of
      the excluded middle (LEM) for a single external negation prefix with respect
      to NLI tasks, despite extensive fine-tuning; and (iii) those models which do
      learn LEM for a single prefix cannot generalize this pattern to similar prefixes.
      However, I then prove theoretically that there does exist a transformer architecture
      capable of modeling LEM, suggesting that current training procedures and/or
      the structure (i.e. lack thereof) of purely textual data may be insufficient
      for transformers to inductively learn LEM. '

      \ that take as input RGB and Depth data respectively. The encoder returns a\
      \ compressed representation of the data and feeds it into the decoder architecture.\
      \ The decoder then reconstructs the compressed data into the original data with\
      \ an average PSNR of 28. Unlike typical autoencoder architectures, HoloZipper\
      \ uses discrete encoder-decoder models to better serve real world applications."

      is a cutting-edge web application designed to revolutionize how car owners manage
      vehicle damage. This innovative platform utilizes advance AI technologies, including
      object detection, instance segmentation, and salient object detection. It also
      swiftly and accurately assess damage from user-uploaded image. Upon assessment,
      SAARTHI classifies the damages into major or minor categories and provides an
      immediate repair cost estimate. This seamless integration of AI not only allows
      users to receive real-time damage evaluations but also enables them to interact
      directly with our chatbot for various roadside assistance services, such as
      calling for instant help, on-the-spot repairs, or towing. Each user creates
      a personal account on our portal, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.
      Once damage is reported and assessed, users can engage with the chatbot to generate
      detailed assessment reports and initiate contact with nearby affiliated repair
      shops for prompt service, all through the SAARTHI application.


      Beyond its technical capabilities, SAARTHI offers significant benefits by enhancing
      transparency and efficiency in the automotive repair and insurance sectors.
      Users are protected from inflated charges with a trustworthy, independent assessment,
      aiding them in navigating the complexities of car repair and insurance claims.
      Additionally, the system streamlines operations for insurance companies by reducing
      reliance on manual inspections, which can be time-consuming and occasionally
      inaccurate. SAARTHI also promotes social well-being by ensuring fair transactions
      and fostering trust in automotive services, ultimately contributing positively
      to societal equity. This project demonstrates its potential to transform the
      automotive service industry through technology-driven solutions and a customer-centric
      design.'

      images. The problem revolves around the need for efficient and accurate recognition
      of traffic signs in real-time scenarios. With the increasing prevalence of autonomous
      vehicles, robust traffic sign recognition is crucial for enhancing road safety
      and improving navigation systems. Also, equipping non-autonomous vehicles with
      this system to assist drivers to improve the quality of driving and ensuring
      safety. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project seeks to address
      the challenges associated with varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and diverse
      sign designs, making it an interesting endeavor in the realm of deep learning
      and transportation technology.

      operate within an adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environment,
      where they compete to gain rewards against each other. The batting agent focuses
      on scoring runs efficiently, while the bowling agent strives to take wickets
      and restrict runs. By simulating competitive scenarios, the agents learn strategic
      decision-making, ultimately enhancing their performance in real-game situations.


      We developed the innovative Decomposed Heuristic Advantage-Driven Efficient
      Learning(DHADEL) technique by decomposing complex tasks into manageable actions
      and rewarding each phase based on advantages gained. This approach enables agents
      to effectively learn intricate skills in cricket batting and bowling, leading
      to improved performance through strategic decision-making.'
