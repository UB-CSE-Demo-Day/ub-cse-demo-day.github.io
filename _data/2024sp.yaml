While, this is great news for indoor automation, there are deployability concerns in terms of generalizability and privacy concerns surrounding it. While, the most popular approach is to use data based ML-models to provide sub-meter accurate localization algorithms, there are still requirements for generalization to different environments and better accuracy.

We developed a web-app to get data from Wi-Fi routers for a given smartphone. The data is then to be processed online to pass through an ML-model.

Parsing4/24/2024 13:12mjs227@buffalo.eduIt is Not True that Transformers are Inductive LearnersI show experimentally that: (i) transformer NLI models treat external negation as a distractor, and effectively ignore its presence in hypothesis sentences; (ii) several near-SoTA models fail to inductively learn the law of the excluded middle (LEM) for a single external negation prefix with respect to NLI tasks, despite extensive fine-tuning; and (iii) those models which do learn LEM for a single prefix cannot generalize this pattern to similar prefixes. However, I then prove theoretically that there does exist a transformer architecture capable of modeling LEM, suggesting that current training procedures and/or the structure (i.e. lack thereof) of purely textual data may be insufficient for transformers to inductively learn LEM.

  - description: 'I show experimentally that: (i) transformer NLI models treat external
      negation as a distractor, and effectively ignore its presence in hypothesis
      sentences; (ii) several near-SoTA models fail to inductively learn the law of
      the excluded middle (LEM) for a single external negation prefix with respect
      to NLI tasks, despite extensive fine-tuning; and (iii) those models which do
      learn LEM for a single prefix cannot generalize this pattern to similar prefixes.
      However, I then prove theoretically that there does exist a transformer architecture
      capable of modeling LEM, suggesting that current training procedures and/or
      the structure (i.e. lack thereof) of purely textual data may be insufficient
      for transformers to inductively learn LEM. '
