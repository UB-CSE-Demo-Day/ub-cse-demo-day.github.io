This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic monitoring system that analyzes live camera feeds to detect and classify anomalies in traffic patterns. The system will learn normal traffic behavior over time and identify deviations that represent anomalous conditions such as accidents, congestion, vehicle breakdowns, or unusual driving patterns.

Unlike traditional traffic monitoring systems that only detect the presence of anomalies, our approach will further classify these anomalies into specific categories (e.g., flow-based anomalies like congestion, behavioral anomalies like erratic driving, infrastructural anomalies like road hazards, and environmental anomalies like weather impacts). This classification capability will enable more targeted responses from traffic management systems.

The project leverages recent advances in deep learning, particularly combining convolutional neural networks for object detection with graph neural networks and LSTM architectures to capture spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By processing real-time video feeds from traffic cameras, our system will provide actionable insights that can help reduce congestion, improve emergency response times, and enhance overall traffic management efficiency.

Our implementation will focus on balancing detection accuracy with real-time processing requirements, ensuring the system can operate effectively in various environmental conditions and traffic scenarios.",CSE4/555: --Pattern Recognition,Poster Only,,"Fagun Patel - fagunnir@buffalo.edu, Sarayu Sivakumar Dhaya - sarayusi@buffalo.edu, Vishali Mani Paramesvari - vishalim@buffalo.edu "

4/21/2025 14:01:12,kem44@buffalo.edu,Materials Microstructure,"Over the ages, new materials have driven innovation and shaped our civilization. The names of the main prehistoric phases of human history, e.g., the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, etc., are the testimony to this statement. The progress has been paralleled by a better understanding of the relationship between (micro)structure and material properties that led to the plethora of materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, LEDs, graphene, organic semiconductors). In recent years, progress in materials research has been fueled by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). To streamline the transition, the information about the materials' structure needs to be converted into an ML-readable format. GraSPI is a software developed at UB that featurizes the micrographs into an array of physically meaningful descriptors that can be directly used in ML pipeline.

In this project, students will enhance an existing GraSPI project. GraSPI uses a graph/network as a data structure to efficiently calculate descriptors from materials micrographs. The project's current version is coded in C/C++ using the boost library. This project aims to translate the current implementation to be python-native (e.g., using NetworkX) or use a boost.Python library. Part of the project will be: - to identify the best strategy for the needed translation (research solution, plan and execute the basic tests with classic graph-based algorithms, and make the suggestion); - plan the translation between two packages - implement the Python packages (core functionality, documentation, example notebooks)",CSE 302/303/402,Includes a demo,https://github.com/owodolab/py-graspi,"laibahah@buffalo.edu - laibahah@buffalo.edu,  joseph55@buffalo.edu -  joseph55@buffalo.edu,  donghwis@buffalo.edu - donghwis@buffalo.edu,   kem44@buffalo.edu - kem44@buffalo.edu"

For comparison, we are also training a classification model using ResNet-50 architecture from scratch. Our goal is to train self-supervised models like BYOL, MoCo, etc. and fine-tune it to get better accuracy.

By simulating real-world negotiation dynamics, the system aims to build adaptive, scalable, and efficient autonomous negotiators capable of handling complex and evolving deal-making environments. Negotiations are formulated as a sequential decision-making process with bounded action spaces, where agents alternately propose and counter-propose offers.The use of clipped surrogate objectives in PPO ensures stable policy updates under the non-stationary dynamics of multi-agent learning.

Dialogue memory is managed with LangChain to maintain context and personalize follow-ups, while confidence thresholds drive an ensemble of discriminative and generative predictions. Upon reaching sufficient certainty, the system issues a chain-of-thought explanation that cites evidence step by step and concludes with tailored precautions. Evaluated on a curated 1000 unique disease corpus, MedLink achieves 95.4 % Top-1 and 99.2 % Top-5 diagnostic accuracy, alongside BLEU 45 % and ROUGE-L 52 % for its generated rationales outperforming traditional classifiers (≤ 52 % accuracy) and single-pass LLMs. By uniting parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), DeepSpeed optimization, and a dynamic multi-agent loop, MedLink delivers transparent, high-fidelity diagnosis.
