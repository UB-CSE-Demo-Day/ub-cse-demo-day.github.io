12/3/2023 19:53,varenmeh@buffalo.edu,Android And Java Malware Detection,This project aims to create a toolchain based around a compiler and machine learning classifier to identify Android and Java malware.  Students will work on modifying an existing compiler (Soot) to analyze Java and Android programs.  The project will involved writing static and dynamic analyses to identify features that can be used by a classifier to make a determination if a given program is malicious or not. The project will begin with students learning about and writing their own intra-procedural information flow analysis.  Students will then extend their intra-procedural information flow analysis to be a whole program inter-procedural information flow analysis.  This analysis will identify the portion of the computation that deals with sensitive and personal data. Students will then write an analysis over this portion of the code to extract features to be used for classification.  The analyses can be extended to handle more complex Java and Android features like reflection and Android IPC mechanisms. There is also room for exploring different machine learning technologies based on performance and accuracy measures.,CSE 302,https://github.com/lziarek/ELR-malware-detection,,"Varen Mehta - varenmeh@buffalo.edu, Nawar Khouri - nawarkho@buffalo.edu, Ria Gupta - riagupta@buffalo.edu,Vrushaali Nagaraj - vrushaal@buffalo.edu"

12/6/2023 18:39,kaushik3@buffalo.edu,Leveraging FHE for Enhancing Soft-Biometric Privacy,"
Face recognition, a cornerstone of early deep learning methodologies, has become a pivotal technology in AI systems, raising concerns regarding privacy and security in widespread applications. Face embeddings, though essential for identity verification, have been shown to be susceptible to leaks, enabling unauthorized access and unintended information extraction. This research investigates existing template protection techniques and their effectiveness in preventing biometric information leaks. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in many existing techniques, emphasizing the need for enhanced privacy safeguards. To address this, we propose a novel dual-layer protection method for face embeddings, combining established protection schemes with an additional encryption layer to fortify privacy. The use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables secure analytics on encrypted templates.
Our approach successfully circumvents the shortcomings of individual protection techniques, providing an elevated level of privacy and security. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through face verification, age, gender and ethnicity prediction tasks, achieving comparable performance to unprotected templates. Leveraging FHE alongside conventional protection methods ensures irreversibility and unlinkability, preserving accuracy while eliminating the risk of biometric information leaks. The project presents comprehensive results supporting the efficacy of our proposed approach in advancing the privacy and security landscape of face recognition systems.",Research ,,,Arjun Ramesh Kaushik - kaushik3@buffalo.edu

This project aims to analyze a countrywide traffic accident dataset covering 49 states in the United States, comprising data from diverse sources such as transportation departments, law enforcement, and traffic sensors. The primary objective is to uncover insights into the causes, frequency, and impact of accidents, ultimately contributing to the development of informed policies and interventions for enhancing road safety.",CSE 587,,,"Dominic Parosh Yamarthi - dyamarth@buffalo.edu, Haripriya Raman - hraman@buffalo.edu"
12/2/2023 17:43,cjtoy@buffalo.edu,Vizier,"Vizier is an advanced, reproducibility-focused notebook environment that supports multiple languages like Scala, Python, and SQL. It uniquely features a spreadsheet mode for direct dataframe editing, templated commands for streamlined data tasks, and an automatic cell update mechanism to maintain data freshness. Additionally, Vizier offers comprehensive history tracking for revisiting or branching analyses and includes a Dataset Stabilizer to monitor and alert about significant data changes, making it a highly adaptable and user-friendly tool for complex data workflows.

The Vizier team is rebuilding their computational notebook Vizier, and wants to take this opportunity to develop a simpler, but more powerful data visualization component.  At a really high level, this component takes in a dataset and spits out a chart based on a set of user-provided instructions. 

This semester, the Vizier team worked to redesign the UI/UX of the editor to allow an easier user experience with the same performance as the previous editor. We introduced a Bar Chart Command where you can see/use our editor. In our editor, we have introduced easier way to add elements, choose filters, change styling, etc.",CSE 302,https://github.com/VizierDB/vizier-scala/wiki,,"Cameron Toy - cjtoy@buffalo.edu, Jason Mai - jtmai2@buffalo.edu,  Shreya Gupta - sgupta45@buffalo.edu"

The patrons would be given a challenging set of scavenger hunt questions, they would have to find the exhibit that satisfies the answer to the question and scan a near field communications (NFC) chip with their smartphone to get credit for answering the question. The application would time the execution of the scavenger hunt and patrons will see their ranking at the end of the scavenger hunt. A companion objective is to develop an administrative application to load and maintain the scavenger hunt information, narrative, photos, etc. for consumption by the patron application. The senior design class will be responsible for defining the project requirements, creating a comprehensive plan, and overseeing its development and deployment",CSE 611: Master's Capstone Project,http://museum-scavenger-hunt.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/,,"? - vdib@buffalo.edu, ? - caceresw@buffalo.edu"
