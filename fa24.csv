While, this is great news for indoor automation, there are deployability concerns in terms of generalizability and privacy concerns surrounding it. While, the most popular approach is to use data based ML-models to provide sub-meter accurate localization algorithms, there are still requirements for generalization to different environments and better accuracy.

During the first semester, the students will develop a web-app to get data from Wi-Fi routers for a given smartphone. The data is then to be processed online to pass through an ML-model. While, there is a baseline ML-model, they should develop and improve the generalizability and accuracy of the localization algorithm (which would be almost similar to object detection problems). The next stage of the project would be to develop quantifiable differential privacy for these learning models, by adding quantifiable noise to the input images.",CSE 302/303,"https://github.com/WS-UB/WLMap/tree/main, https://github.com/WS-UB/WL-Local-Server","Wireless Systems, Indoor Localization, Navigation, Kotlin, PySpark, MQTT Server, MLOps","Jessica Gow - jagow2@buffalo.edu, Tien Tran - tientran@buffalo.edu, Harrison Moore - hemoore3@buffalo.edu, Sameep Kotecha - sameepko@buffalo.edu, (PM) Gary Chhina - gauravji@buffalo.edu "
11/6/2024 14:26:02,srwarjj7@gmail.com,Study of Fake review detection using Machine learning Algorithms,"Fake review detection has become increasingly im-
portant as online platforms rely heavily on user-generated content
to influence consumer decisions. Fake reviews can distort public
perception, undermine trust in services, and mislead potential
buyers. Detecting these deceptive reviews is a challenging task
due to their subtle nature and the sheer volume of data on
digital platforms. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful
solution to this problem by automatically identifying patterns
and anomalies in large datasets that may indicate fraudulent
activity. By analyzing textual features and review behavior, ML
models can classify reviews as fake or genuine with high accuracy,
providing a scalable and efficient way to safeguard the integrity
of online platforms. This project implements machine learning
algorithms to build a robust system for detecting fake reviews,

This project introduces an adaptive driver assistance framework using a single Vision Transformer (ViT) model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient multi-task classification, significantly reducing parameters while maintaining high accuracy. Leveraging the JAAD dataset, our approach integrates YOLOv8 for pedestrian detection and a contextual classification framework to assess pedestrian density, road type, time of day, and weather. Pedestrian behavior is modeled by predicting crossing intent, occlusion, and gaze direction, with a rule-based system for adaptive decision-making in critical scenarios. By experimenting with various LoRA techniques—such as AdaLoRA, IA3, LoHA, and LoKr—we reduce trainable parameters to 0.35\%, achieving high computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our model achieves over 90\% accuracy across tasks, demonstrating the robustness of this adaptive approach for real-time applications.
